# Problem Statement:
# An organization has a unique freezer room with easy-to-adjust temperature, lock with
# keys, manual defrost option, and basket or adjustable shelf etc. Employees of this
# organization keep moving in and out of the freezer room on work. Organization uses a
# unique employee ID and smart card to identify their employeeâ€™s movement to the
# freezer room. Whenever the employee swipes his card to the freezer room employee ID
# is recorded. When an employee enters the room for the first time, the counter is set to 1.
# From then onwards, each time an employee swipes out of the room the counter is
# incremented and incremented again when he enters back. If the counter is odd, it
# means the employee is inside the freezer room and if the counter is even, it means
# he/she is out of the room.

# The organization uses this data to perform the following analytics:
# 1. How many employees entered the freezer room today?
# 2. Number of employees that have entered the freezer room today and are currently inside?
# 3. Check if a specific employee is inside the freezer room or outside?
# 4. List of employees that have swiped (in or out) more than x number of times?
# 5. Which employee ids within a range of IDs entered the freezer room, the swipe counter for
# them, and whether they are inside or outside the freezer room
